    'Consumer complaint narrative': 'Was a happy XXXX card member for years, in late XX/XX/2016 XXXX converted the card portfolio to Barclaycard ( XXXX ). We almost never carry a balance over, but we started to in XX/XX/XXXX and Barclay has been overcharging the interest expense every month. Instead of charging interest on the carried balance they charged it on the entire average balance. So if we charged {$3000.00} last month and carried {$3000.00} from previous months then they charged us 15 % of the {$6000.00} = {$75.00}, should have been {$37.00} in interest charges. They are double dipping, getting the interchange fee ( 1.5 % of purchase, equal to an 18 % apr ), plus they are getting the interest on the purchases at 15 %, that is the equivalent of an 33 % interest charge. \r\nI feel this practice is very unethical, if not illegal. We converted, not by our choice, from XXXX to Barclaycard MasterCard, so if we leave we lose all the points we acquired in previous years. Completely unfair and is why the big financials have the hated reputation they have now. Hope you folks over there can investigate.',

My statements were sent by e-mail and I would then pay online, always in full. Last XXXX, I did not receive a statement from Target. I do not remember the exact dates for all of my financial obligations and rely on statements from my creditors. Two months later, I received an e-mail from Target informing me they were turning me over to a collection agency. I called them and told them I wanted to pay the debt in full but also wanted to cancel the card because their statement system did not seem adequate ( i.e. no statements sent ) and I could n\'t take any chances with ruining my credit. They informed me that it was my responsibility to know when the bills were due and if I cancelled my care, I would never be able to get another one again. I told them that was fine, this was n\'t working for me, and I had other credit cards. I paid the card in full and owed nothing to Target. In XXXX of 2016, I applied for new car insurance because it was much cheaper. I was told that I would have to pay {$150.00} more for insurance because I had an entry on my credit card. I got a copy of my credit report, and for the first time in my adult life ( I \'m XXXX ), I had a bad credit report from Target. I am now also applying for XXXX jobs and have found out this can also affect my ability to get a job. Target does not have any customer service contacts for this issue as I do not have a Target Red Card anymore and you need a card number to log in into the customer service portal. There is no other mechanism for contacting them about this issue. My question is, if I paid them in full two months after the debt was due, why have they ruined my credit rating? This card has cost me far more than I ever saved by using it and now it is going to potentially impair my ability to get a job. I feel as if I \'ve committed a felony and I would like Target to resolve this ; I do n\'t owe them anything and they did n\'t have to pay anything to collect the debt.

I have never applied to Barclay Card for a credit card. I telephoned Barclay Card and was put in touch with a security consultant. She asked for my identifying number. I gave her the number. She returned to the line and asked me for my DOB and SSN. I told her that since she had pulled up my information, she could tell me the information and I would verify if was me. She stated she could not do that. I asked to speak to a supervisor. Another female got on the telephone and basically re- invented the wheel. She told me the same information. At this point I hung up. I went into XXXX XXXX and saw that a hard credit inquiry had posted on my credit history.

    'Consumer complaint narrative': 'The credit card company ( American Express ) changed my credit card from one type ( Blue Cash ) to another ( Blue Cash Everyday ) without my consent, and I would lose cash back money because of that.

Now, just when I am about to reach this limit, the credit card company has sent me a letter notifying me that my card has been converted to a different type, which has a completely different cash back system, and as a result, I would receive much lower cash back compared to what I would have gotten with the old card upon reaching the {$6500.00} limit. I contacted their customer service many times and all of their agents understood my issue, but ultimately did n\'t do anything other than apologizing to me. I told to the agents that this is cheating, and they said that this is a company-wide policy and they have no control on it. As a solution, I offered them to change my card after my current cycle ends, but they denied it. I also offered them to give a higher cash back on previous and future purchases to compensate for my loss, but they denied it.',

    'Consumer complaint narrative': 'My husband lost his job and I was unable to pay my credit card payment for some time. After my account charged off Capital One has sent my account to a collection agency XXXX Attorney \'s at Law. I began making token payments every few months and I got a letter from XXXX stating that as long as I continued to pay according to the agreement that we had made they would not take my account to court. I have never spoken on the phone with them, I have never made any sort of arrangements with them. So I continued to make payments when I could, as much as I could. I did not get monthly billing statements, I did not even know what my balance was at any given time. In XXXX 2015 I did finally get a bill stating that I owed {$1100.00} on my account and for XXXX my husband paid off my account for me on XXXX/XXXX/2015. To my horror I just discovered that this firm has filed suit against me in court Case XXXX. To my knowledge my account, although previously charged off, should be paid in full and should be reporting as such to the credit agencies now. I feel that this is a violation of UDAAP as it was deceptive to pretend that they had entered into some sort of an agreement with me without ever speaking with me. I feel it is abusive to continue to collect a debt and even file suit against a debtor that has paid off their account. I feel that it is unfair to not send monthly billing statements to a customer and expect them to know what is owed on a loan. Service providers for large banks should be held to the same standard as the big banks.',

When I learned one year ago that XXXX would discontinue this relationship, I called XXXX XXXX to tell them I did not want my card transferred to another company without my permission. I was assured it would be my choice. My XXXX membership ended within the past year. I cancelled my XXXX XXXX card over one month ago. XXXX XXXX let customers know that they would be getting Citi cards only a couple months ago. I then called Citi and was told there was nothing they could do at this time. Today, I received a note that I would be issued a Citi card even though I have expressed to XXXX, XXXX XXXX and Citi that I DO NOT WANT A CARD FROM CITI. I called the phone number and was told that I WOULD be getting a new card and had no say in the matter as " This was all put together a year ago and we do n\'t have any access to your information until the deal goes through on XXXX/XXXX/16. So we have no access. \'\' I said, " But it says my new card will arrive in XX/XX/XXXX, so you must have access, and I demand that you close that account. \'\' I was told that Citi could not help me. \r\n\r\nThis is absolutely aggregious, because, not only did I not request the card, I requested of all parties that I not be issued a new card. All parties above insist there is nothing they can do. What will occur is that I will get a card and have to immediately close it, and likely it will negatively affect my credit, showing as a short term account and decreasing my length of credit account marks on my credit, especially since I had already closed my XXXX in the same year. Since I am not a XXXX member, the CITI card has no use to me. \r\n\r\nHow this could be legal confounds me. I believe this should be highly ILLEGAL. I also believe it is fraudulent with the way customers have been dealt with over the past year. Customers and their private information should not be traded between banks without their say so. \r\n\r\nI have attached the letter received today. At the bottom, it says that to get a card you must have an open XXXX account. However, the woman on the phone, who did not give her name, told me I would receive one no matter what. She was extremely rude and seemed to enjoy denying my request. \r\n\r\nPlease note that your form requests the credit card number.

I however, kept repeating that this was not a XXXX transaction since the payment to XXXX Airways was in XXXX and not in XXXX. \r\nXXXX of their executives in the Claims department went on to say that because i was flying outside XXXX they consider it a XXXX transaction. Which does not make any sense to me. \r\nA XXXX transaction would be one where my Bank would have to pay to the vendor in a currency different from XXXX. That did not happen here.',

    'Consumer complaint narrative': 'On XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to use XXXX of my CapitalOne credit cards and it was declined. I called into CapitalOne customer service and was forwarded to an XXXX department and a customer service agent named XXXX. XXXX explained that my accounts were closed on XX/XX/XXXX due to activity that CapitalOne deemed uncustomary. XXXX was not able to identify what activity was deemed uncustomary. I had XXXX CapitalOne credit card accounts, XXXX opened in XX/XX/XXXX and the other opened in XXXX. The XXXX credit card was originally an XXXX credit card that CapitalOne took over due to their merger. XXXX said that I have no recourse except to apply for a new CapitalOne account. When I spoke to a new credit card product agent, the offers that were provided to me, did not match the previous benefits of my accounts that were closed. XXXX told me that CapitalOne is completely within their rights as stated in my customer agreement, to have closed my accounts in this fashion. What I do n\'t understand, is that I \'ve had both of these cards for very lengthy periods of time, I have not used them recently in any manner that I have not used them in the past. In other words, there is no current or recent activity, that is any different from the activity over the past 9 years or 6 years. My credit card ending in XXXX ( the card opened in XX/XX/XXXX ), I have used for balance transfers, for 9 years, so there is no activity now that does not match previous activity. My credit card ending in XXXX ( the card opened in XX/XX/XXXX ), I have used to take XXXX ( taxicab service ) and pay for laundry machines, for at least the past 12 months. So again, there is no new/recent activity, that is any different than previous activity, that should have caused my accounts to be closed. I understand that CapitalOne may be within their rights but they should be able to provide valid reasons for these actions. Since I was offered new credit card products, that do not have the same benefits as my previous accounts, I feel as though I am being discriminated against unfairly. There is no ( abnormal ) activity that justifies closing my XXXX and XXXX accounts. How does CapitalOne have the right to close my accounts and not provide me with specific reasons? And then provide me with the only recourse of applying for new accounts ( thereby losing all of my previous account history ) that do not have the identical benefits of my previous accounts? If CapitalOne wanted to remove benefits from my old accounts, why not just do that? I am hoping that the CFPB can help XXXX why my accounts were truly closed. My accounts had been current. No missed payments, no late payments, no refused payments, etc. There was no new activity that was any different than previous activity, namely balance transfers and XXXX charges. I also do not understand why there is no recourse to reopen my accounts. CapitalOne should not be allowed to be so vague. I do not know if I \'m being discriminated against because I had benefits that CapitalOne chooses to no longer offer, but closing XXXX current credit card accounts with a lengthy history of valid use, impacts me very negatively. Now XXXX credit card accounts there were in good standing for XXXX and 9 years, will negatively impact my credit score and credit history, and CapitalOne provides no valid explanation, other than " activity we deem uncustomary \'\'. The total credit line between my prior XXXX cards was {$7600.00}. Please help.',

It said that I had until XXXX XXXX to cancel the transfer. I called them to cancel the transaction and they said they wanted to check my credit again to see if they could approve the whole amount. It came back as a denial because I had too many credit cards with balances. They said I would get a credit denial in the mail. I told them that I wanted to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor said they could n\'t cancel the card because the transfer was already being processed. After I complained a lot, citing the letter I had from them that said I had 4 more days to cancel, the supervisor finally said my card will be cancelled. She could not tell me why they promoted a card offering balance transfers and then used those balances against me, saying that I had too many credit cards. Now I have XXXX bad marks on my credit report because I was denied credit when they insisted on running it through again and because I cancelled their card. I was trying to be responsible by consolidating cards and paying off my debt. People should know that this is a scam.

After my payment, my card had a credit balance of {$2100.00} and a credit balance of {$3600.00}. My local Lowe \'s store tried numerous times to run my card for about {$5100.00} but it kept getting declined. Even when I called the credit card company and they said everything was okay.Finally I got a supervisor they then told me I could n\'t charge more then {$2100.00} and I would have to charge it multiple times.The store would n\'t allow this. When I had a credit of {$600.00} I would pay a cash payment at the store then I was able to buy products or charges over {$600.00} without a problem.Now suddenly have a problem after they increased my limit. I called the credit department several times and was finally told that they would no longer allow me to charge over my credit limit even though I had a credit balance. I was told they would send me a refund check which I would have to cash and then take the cash back to the store. I have been trying to resolve this for over 6 days. The credit manager told me the check was sent XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/16 but did not have the tracking number. I called back on XXXX/XXXX/16 because I did not get the refund. I am now being told the refund just went out today XXXX/XXXX/16 but still no tracking number is available and it will take over 4 days which means it will be over 2 weeks to get my money back and get my purchase taken care of.',
